 - Our website features a "Trending" section that highlights products gaining significant user interest. When multiple users search for the same product and the search volume surpasses a predefined threshold, the product is marked as trending. This section is updated in real-time, ensuring users have access to the most current and popular items. By prominently displaying these trending products, we enhance user engagement and satisfaction, making it easier for users to discover whatâ€™s popular. For businesses, this feature increases product visibility and provides valuable insights into consumer behavior, helping them adjust their strategies to meet market demands.
 - Our website features a "Smart Search" functionality that allows users to search for products using images. By simply uploading a picture, users can find exact matches or similar items available on our platform. This innovative feature leverages advanced image recognition technology to analyze the uploaded image and compare it against our extensive product database. It provides an intuitive and efficient way to discover products, especially for those who may not know the exact name or details of what they are looking for. The "Smart Search" enhances the user experience by simplifying the search process, making it easier and faster to find desired products with just a photo.
